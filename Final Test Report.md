| Reset Game | Clears score and progress instantly | Low |
| Leaderboard | Stores top 3 scores in localStorage | Medium |
| Bonus Round | Every 3 puzzles ‚Üí doubles score | High |

## Test Plan

### Objectives

- Verify functionality, stability, and correctness of key game features.
- Ensure leaderboard data persists correctly across browser sessions.
- Validate bonus scoring logic and accurate reset behavior.  
- Identify and document defects with reproducible steps.  

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Functional testing of core gameplay (input validation, score updates).
- UI validation on Chrome Desktop (responsiveness, usability).
- LocalStorage persistence verification (leaderboard data).
- Bonus round scoring and reset functionality.  

**Out of Scope:**
- Mobile browser compatibility.
- Accessibility testing (screen readers).
- Performance/load testing.
- Integration with external APIs or multiplayer features.  

### Tools & Resources

## Risk Analysis

### Risks

| ID | Feature | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|----|---------|------------------|------------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| R1 | Leaderboard | Leaderboard data is lost if the user clears their browser cache, as it relies on `localStorage` | High | Medium | High | Retest after cache clear; backup data option|  
| R2 | Bonus Round | The score calculation in incorrect if the player's score is 0 when the bonus is applied | Medium | High | High | Add unit test and verify with multiple round sequences|
| R3 | Reset Game | A user might accidentally click 'Reset' and lose their score instantly, as there is no confirmation dialog | High | Medium | High | Add a confirmation modal before reset; implement an undo option |  
| R4 | Leaderboard | The leaderboard does not sort scores correctly if multiple players have the same score | Medium | Medium | Medium | Add sorting test cases; implement tie-breaking logic by timestamp |
|R5 | Bonus Round | The bonus round trigger is not activated correctly if the 'PuzzlesSolved' count is not updated properly | Low | High | Medium | Validate counter update in event handlers; add regression test for trigger logic  |  
| R6 | Usability | The game is not intuitive for new users who may not undestand the soring and bonus system without reading the rules | High | Low | Medium | Add tooltips or onboarding hints; include a ‚ÄúHow to Play‚Äù popup |

### Risk Coverage

- Tested Risks Percent: 90%
- Untested Risks Percent: 10% (due to limited negative testing on browser storage)

## Test Cases

| ID | Feature | Objective | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status | Risk Link |
|----|---------|-----------|----------------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| TC01 | Leaderboard | Verify that leaderboard data persists after browser refresh | Leaderboard retains top 3 scores after reload | The Leaderboard retains top 3 scores after reload | Passed | R1 |
| TC02 | Leaderboard | Check leaderboard persistence after clearing cache or localStorage | Leaderboard data should not be cleared, backup/export option should be available | Leaderboard data is cleared, backup/export option should be available | Failed | R1 |

| TC04 | Reset Game | Confirm app resets score and progress instantly | Score resets to 0; all states cleared | The score resets to 0; all states cleared | Passed | R3 |  
| TC05 | Reset Game | Verify confirmation before reset | The user should receives ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù confirmation prompt before data loss | The game reset automatically without confirmation prompt | Failed | R3 |
|TC06 | Leaderboard | Ensure leaderboard sorts correctly when multiple players have same score | Scores with same value should appear in correct order(alphabetically based on player name or number) | Score is with same value not differentiated  | Failed | R4 |  
| TC07 | Bonus Round | Confirm bonus trigger activates after every 3 puzzles | Bonus applies correctly every 3 solved puzzles | Bonus applies correctly every 3 solved puzzles | Passed | R5 |
| TC08 | Usability | Check if rules and scoring info are easily accessible to new users | Users can find rules within 1 click and understand gameplay | Users can find rules within 1 click and understand gameplay | Passed| R6 |
| TC09 | Usability | Test first-time player experience without reading the rules | Users understand how bonus works without reading long text| Users struggle to understand scoring until after first few rounds | Failed | R6|
